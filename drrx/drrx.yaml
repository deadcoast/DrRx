# Directory Remedy [Dr.Rx] Reinforcing Directory Tree Syntax
# CLI Design Patterns (Command Line Interface Design Patterns)
directory_remedy:
  description: "A strict directory tree syntax (Dr.Rx) file that declaratively manages a target Windows directory. Idempotent: repeated application converges FS to declared state."
  cli_command:
    name: "drrx"
    alias: "drrxm"
    principle: "Manage a directory based on one Dr.Rx tree file; indentation defines structure; operators declare directories/files; annotations can affect presence and sourcing."
    commands:
      - name: "lint"
        description: "Emit JSON diagnostics for one or more Dr.Rx files."
        example: 'drrx path\\to\\spec.tree.drrx'
