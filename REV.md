# REVISIONS

Generate a worked AST JSON example from the “Example DrRx Tree Syntax” and validate against drrx/ast.schema.json:

- Add a small “Rules Reference” sidebar block to all syntax docs to keep rule links at hand
- Add a JSON Schema for the Dr.Rx source annotations subset and a --json format for list --diff
- Add a WN.02 rule for long path support (and link it from the overview)
- Insert back-links from rules to specific sections in syntax-overview.md for faster navigation
